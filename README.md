# Q1
# An alternate course allocation Portal
In this problem we have to simulate the allocation of TA to a course, tutorial taking place and students filling their prefernces and choosing their course.<br>
For more details see [README OF QUES 1](./q1/README.md)<br>

# Q3
# Multithreaded client and server
We have a client that has m strings that they want to send to server for processing, these m strings have to send at a particular instance so it is seen as multithreaded client (having m threads) that connect with a server room<br>
The server room has n threads to send back the data<br>
